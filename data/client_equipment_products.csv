Additional local signaling includes green LED power-on indicator, flashing yellow LED for accuracy checking, an overload alarm and communication indicators. This meter can be used in sub-billing applications and supports 4 tariff schedules. The meter provides the following accuracy classes: Active Energy: class 0.5S per IEC 62053-22, Active Energy: class C per EN 50470-3 and Active Energy: class 0.5S per IEC 61557-12. The meter will measure Active and Reactive Power, Active and Reactive Energy, Voltage and Current. With four quadrant Energy measurement. Designed for 50Hz or 60Hz networks, supply voltage can range from 100 to 277VAC or 173 to 480VAC. The rated current goes through a 1A or 5A transfomer to be measured in this meter and will support Single Phase and Neutral, Three Phase and Three Phase and Neutral configurations. Communication protocol is Modbus with screw terminal support. There is one programmable digital input and one programmable digital output that can be used as a pulsed output. Certifications include EAC, CE, UL and MID. Product dimensions are as follows: width 3.54 in (90 mm), depth 2.72in (69 mm), height 3.74 in (95 mm) and product weight 9.17 oz (260 g).
